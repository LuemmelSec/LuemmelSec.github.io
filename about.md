Hey fellas, my name is Daniel and I am just a normal IT guy who is interested in InfoSec.  
I currently work as a pentester at [r-tec](https://www.r-tec.net/home.html) in Germany pwning the world :)  

This is my blog that I run and maintain in my sparetime.  
ItÂ´s intention is to help me build, deepen and share knowledge.  

If you have any suggestions, think that I am terribly wrong at some point or could improve somewhere - feel free to reach out to me as I am here to learn, too.
