Hey fellas, my name is Daniel and I am just a normal IT guy who is interested in InfoSec.  

This is my blog that I run and maintain in my sparetime.  
ItÂ´s intention is to help me build, deepen and share knowledge.  

If you have any suggestions, think that I am terribly wrong at some point or could improve somewhere - feel free to reach out to me as I am here to learn, too.
