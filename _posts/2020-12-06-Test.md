title: My Way Into InfoSec
---

This is my very first blog post ever, which I am trying to use to get a little into github (pages), and because I was in the mood to write some shit.  
As I am fairly new into being a fulltime InfoSec guy, IÂ´ll be writing about how I got into it and how I landed my current job as a pentester.  
This also will reflect my point of view regarding **the right mindset** and **certifications** that might get you started.

## Introduction
A little story about me:  
As the time of writing I am 37 years old, had a fulltime job as Senior Security Architect (meaning that I worked with all McAfee Endpoint related stuff) for almost 2 years, and was offered the 
oppertunity to join the pentest-team at my current company.
