title: My Way Into InfoSec
---

This is my very first blog post ever, which I am trying to use to get a little into github (pages), and because I was in the mood to write some shit.  
As I am fairly new into being a fulltime InfoSec guy, IÂ´ll be writing about how I got into it and how I landed my current job as a pentester.  
This also will reflect my point of view regarding **the right mindset** and **certifications** that might get you started.

## Introduction
A little story about me:  
As the time of writing I am 37 years old.  
I had a job as a normal admin for about 8 years, before joining my current company like 2,5 years ago.  
Here I started as Senior Security Engineer (meaning that I worked with all McAfee Endpoint related stuff) for over 2 years, and was recently offered the 
chance to join our pentest-team in the position as Security Consultant. Why everyone is naming job positions to their likings is a mystery I will never be able understand.  
So here I am. A total noob regarding penetration-testing, doing stuff that others get arrested for legally and getting payed for it. Or in other words:  
**I finally arrived where I always wanted to be** (at least I believe so).
