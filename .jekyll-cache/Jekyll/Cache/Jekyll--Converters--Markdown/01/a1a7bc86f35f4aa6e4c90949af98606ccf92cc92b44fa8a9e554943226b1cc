I"<p>This is my very first blog post ever, which I am trying to use to get a little into github (pages), and because I was in the mood to write something.<br />
As I am fairly new into being a fulltime InfoSec guy, IÂ´ll be writing about how I got into it and how I landed my current job as a pentester.<br />
This will also reflect my point of view regarding <strong>the right mindset</strong> and <strong>certifications</strong> that might get you started.</p>
