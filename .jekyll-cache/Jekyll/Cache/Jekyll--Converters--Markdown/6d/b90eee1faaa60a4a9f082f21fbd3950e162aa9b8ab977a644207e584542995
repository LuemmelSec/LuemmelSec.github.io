I"¥<p>In this blog-post I am trying to demystify SMTP (<em>at least for myself</em>).<br />
What exactly is it used for? What parties are involved? What about authentication and when? What attack surfaces are you opening with incorrect settings?</p>

<p>As you may have read in the other posts, I will most likely try to reflect my knowledge on specific topics or work on certain problems I face (mainly during work), where these blog-posts are aimed to help me.</p>

<p>This time itÂ´s all about SMTP in regards of possible attacks and countermeasures, all from the point of view of an external attacker.</p>
