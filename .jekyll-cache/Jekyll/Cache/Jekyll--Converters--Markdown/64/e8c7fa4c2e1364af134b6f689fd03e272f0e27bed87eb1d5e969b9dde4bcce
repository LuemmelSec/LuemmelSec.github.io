I"ó<p>My dear Bagginses and Boffins, Tooks and Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and Proudfoots - it is time for some new shit.<br />
We are going to explore the wonderful world of Active Directory Certificate Services, aka ADCS.<br />
If you want to leave an impression on your next pentest, this oneâ€™s for you, as Microsoftâ€™s PKI implementation is widely used but little understood (well at least in terms of security).<br />
Same is true if you live on the blue side, as you can proactively mitigate issues an earn some bonus points with your boss, maybe.<br />
Prepare yourself for a shitload of pictures, memes, usefull as well as meaningless information.</p>
