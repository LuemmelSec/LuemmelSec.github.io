I"/<p>Hey fellas, welcome to my blog.<br />
My name is Daniel and I am just a normal IT guy who is interested in InfoSec.<br />
I grew up with computers thanks to my dad, and work in IT since 2006.<br />
My InfoSec-only career started in 2018 as a IT-Security &lt;put cyber wording here&gt;.</p>

<p>I run and maintain this pile of shitposts in my sparetime.<br />
It´s intention is to help me (and probably you) build, deepen and share knowledge regarding a variety of InfoSec topics, whereby the fun should not come too short. 
So whenever there is a larger topic that I can’t wrap my head around, I try to rebuild the scenarios in my lab, play around, and bring my experience to paper.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, think that I am terribly wrong at some point or could improve somewhere - feel free to reach out to me as I am here to learn, too. Every feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>Please enjoy my writeups as much as I do.</p>

<p>If you are more into shorter pieces of info with more recent updates, go follow me on Twitter.</p>

<p>Cheers, Dan.</p>
